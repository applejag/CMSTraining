# CMSTraining

My personal repository I am using while following through the EPiServer CMS exercise book.

I am doing this on a repository because I have to move between computers, and want to seamlessly continue my schooling.

> **Note to self:** As I've added the localdb to this repo, it includes some accounds.
> For the testing admin account I didn't use the password as instructed in the exercise, but instead Chrome filled out an automatic password for me.
>
> Passwords in the testing localdb that follows the repository:  
> `admin`: `C-p5WUZ2DvSNAs!`  
> _the rest_: _same as in the book. for the most part `Pa$$w0rd`_
